Oleg,Slava

General discussion
=========================
-> single dissociation - was already published (Oleg et al) - what would be the goal to continue? Perhaps new data from LHC, parameter fits.
-> double dissociatoin - similar story (Salii et al)
-> central production - would be new for us, but need to define what the novelty is. Perhaps Laszlo's amplitude?

Next steps
==========
-> General proposal: concentrate on CDP first
-> Define more clearly the goals. What observables, which sets of data. Is there any data from LHC on CDP? Check with Laszlo (fancy amplitude we could use?)
-> check formulas
-> merge two software packages (Olegs and Slavas) so that there is one common tool to use. Use git server so everyone can track changes and use latest software easily
-> clarify what reggevako means

Next meeting
