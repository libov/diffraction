---------------------

* full rapidity range dSigma/dy and dSigma/dW (proton proton) cross sections for jpsi, comparing power law and geometric model, two curves on each plot, two plots; no data
* dSigma/dy, zoomed in y, together with LHCb data, standard power law vs geometric; fitted power law vs standard; summary plot - together with log.

* W plot..
